            Abstraction
        Data abstraction is the concept of providing only essential information to the outside world.
        It's a process of representing essential features without including implementation details.
        Abstraction means, that we can have an idea or a concept that is completely separate from any specific instance.

        Example:
        cout << "Hello!" << endl;

        There is no need to understand how cout will display the text on the user's screen.
        The only thing you need to know to be able to use it is the public interface.
